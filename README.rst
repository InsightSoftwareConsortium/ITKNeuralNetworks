Overview
--------

This is a neural networks remote module for the `Insight Toolkit (ITK) <http://itk.org>`_.

This remote module contains classes and support classes for the calculation of
artificial neural networks. This can be used, for instance, for image
classification.

For additional information and classes for ITK Neural Network IO operations,
